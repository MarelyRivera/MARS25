# MARS25
This repository holds some of the main files for the MARS 2025 Lunabotics Competition

All of the folders that are needed can be found on the Desktop of the LattePanda Computer in a folder called MARS2025. 
There you can go through and test Henry (our robot). Make sure to follow the guides.
